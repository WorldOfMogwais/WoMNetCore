In the mirror world of the Mogwais the downfall of the worlds has already began. An all-distorting darkness nourished by the vices of the worlds has taken over a large part of their living space.
Suppressed by the darkness, the mogwais transformed into evil and deceitful creatures.
In their viciousness they torment the souls of our ancestors on their last journey through the worlds.

But not all have succumbed to the evil force, still there are individuals who haven't been touched by the darkness.
Over a mystical cryptographical phenomenon an unknown relation was discovered.
Find a way to unite with the untouched mogwais to fight against evil darkness.
